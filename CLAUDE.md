# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project

**Feudum** — a medieval browser strategy game built from scratch, mechanically inspired by classic OGame (pre-microtransaction era). This is NOT a fork or modification of OGame; it is a clean reimplementation with a medieval theme.

**Live URLs:**
- Production: https://ogame-xi.vercel.app
- GitHub: https://github.com/anpages/feudum

## Commands

```bash
npm run dev          # Vite dev server (localhost:5173)
npm run build        # tsc -b && vite build
npm run lint         # ESLint

# Database (requires DATABASE_URL in .env.local)
npm run db:generate  # Generate migration SQL from schema changes
npm run db:migrate   # Apply pending migrations to Neon
npm run db:studio    # Open Drizzle Studio (DB browser)

# Deploy
vercel --prod        # Deploy to production
```

To load env vars for DB commands in the shell: `set -a && source .env.local && set +a`

## OGame reference repo

**Path:** `/home/anpages/ogame-ref` — local clone of OGameX (PHP/Laravel). **Read-only.**
Always consult it before implementing any game mechanic to extract the exact formulas.

### Key files to read per feature

| Feature | Reference file(s) |
|---------|------------------|
| Building costs & production formulas | `app/GameObjects/BuildingObjects.php` |
| Research costs & requirements | `app/GameObjects/ResearchObjects.php` |
| Ship / unit stats & costs | `app/GameObjects/MilitaryShipObjects.php`, `CivilShipObjects.php` |
| Defense stats & costs | `app/GameObjects/DefenseObjects.php` |
| Build time formula | `app/Services/PlanetService.php` → `getBuildingConstructionTime()` |
| Unit build time | `app/Services/PlanetService.php` → `getUnitConstructionTime()` |
| Resource production tick | `app/Services/PlanetService.php` → `updateResourcesUntil()` |
| Building queue logic | `app/Services/BuildingQueueService.php` |
| Research queue logic | `app/Services/ResearchQueueService.php` |
| Unit queue logic | `app/Services/UnitQueueService.php` |
| Fleet / army missions | `app/GameMissions/AttackMission.php`, `TransportMission.php`, etc. |
| Battle engine | `app/BattleEngine/` |
| Galaxy / map | `app/Http/Controllers/GalaxyController.php` |

### Core formulas extracted from reference

**Resource production per hour** (store result in `kingdoms.*_production`):
```
wood  (sawmill   lv): 30 * lv * 1.1^lv
stone (quarry    lv): 20 * lv * 1.1^lv
grain (grainFarm lv): 10 * lv * 1.1^lv  (no temperature factor in medieval variant)
population (windmill lv): 20 * lv * 1.1^lv
```

**Building cost** — base costs × factor^(level-1):
```
sawmill:   60 wood, 15 stone, factor 1.5
quarry:    48 wood, 24 stone, factor 1.6
grainFarm: 225 wood, 75 stone, factor 1.5
windmill:  75 wood, 30 stone, factor 1.5
```

**Building construction time (seconds)**:
```
time = ((wood + stone) / (2500 * max(4 - nextLevel/2, 1) * (1 + workshop) * speed * 2^engineersGuild)) * 3600
minimum: 1 second
```
`workshop` = Workshop level (robot_factory), `engineersGuild` = Engineers Guild level (nano_factory), `speed` = server economy speed (default 1).

## Architecture

### Stack

| Layer | Tech |
|-------|------|
| Frontend | Vite + React 19 + TypeScript |
| Styling | Tailwind CSS v4 (CSS-first config in `src/index.css`) |
| Data fetching | React Query — global polling every 10s (`staleTime: 5s`) |
| State | Zustand (available for global UI state) |
| Backend | Hono — all routes under `/api`, deployed as Vercel serverless functions |
| Database | Neon (serverless PostgreSQL) via `@neondatabase/serverless` |
| ORM | Drizzle ORM — schema in `db/schema/`, migrations in `db/migrations/` |
| Auth | Better Auth (not yet wired up) |
| Deploy | Vercel — `vercel.json` rewrites `/api/*` → `api/index.ts` |

### Real-time approach

Vercel serverless doesn't support persistent WebSockets. Game state is fetched via React Query polling (10s interval). Resource counts are interpolated locally every second in `useResourceTicker` using server-provided production rates — this keeps the UI feeling live without extra requests.

### Folder layout

```
api/index.ts           Hono entry point — mount new routers here
api/routes/            One file per feature domain
db/schema/             Drizzle table definitions (one file per domain)
db/index.ts            Neon connection + re-exports all schema types
src/components/layout/ GameLayout, ResourceBar, NavBar
src/hooks/             useKingdom (React Query), useResourceTicker (local ticker)
src/lib/api.ts         Thin fetch wrapper (api.get / api.post / api.patch)
src/lib/format.ts      formatResource, formatDuration
src/pages/             One file per route — mostly placeholders
```

### tsconfig split

- `tsconfig.app.json` — covers `src/` only (browser + Vite client types)
- `tsconfig.node.json` — covers `api/`, `db/`, `vite.config.ts`, `drizzle.config.ts` (Node types)

### Adding a new API route

1. Create `api/routes/<feature>.ts` exporting a `new Hono()` router
2. Mount it in `api/index.ts`: `app.route('/<feature>', featureRouter)`
3. Add a corresponding hook in `src/hooks/use<Feature>.ts` using `api.get()`

### Adding a new DB table

1. Add a file in `db/schema/<table>.ts`
2. Export it from `db/schema/index.ts`
3. Run `npm run db:generate` then `npm run db:migrate`

## Theme mapping (OGame → Feudum)

| OGame | Feudum |
|-------|--------|
| Metal / Metal mine | Wood / Sawmill |
| Crystal / Crystal mine | Stone / Quarry |
| Deuterium / Synthesizer | Grain / Grain Farm |
| Solar plant | Windmill |
| Fusion reactor | Cathedral |
| Robot factory | Workshop |
| Nano factory | Engineers Guild |
| Shipyard | Barracks |
| Research lab | Academy |
| Planet | Kingdom |
| Galaxy / System / Position | Realm / Region / Slot |
| Fleet mission | Army mission |
| Espionage probe | Scout |
| Colony ship | Colonist |
| Recycler | Scavenger |
| Light/Heavy fighter | Squire / Knight |
| Cruiser / Battleship | Paladin / Warlord |
| Battlecruiser / Bomber | Grand Knight / Siege Master |
| Destroyer / Deathstar | War Machine / Dragon Knight |

Research mapping: see `db/schema/research.ts` — each field has an inline comment with the OGame equivalent.

## Design tokens

Custom Tailwind colors defined in `src/index.css` via `@theme`:
- `parchment` / `parchment-dark` — main text / surface colors
- `gold` / `gold-light` — primary accent (headings, active nav)
- `crimson` — danger / full resources
- `forest` — secondary accent
- `ink` — dark text on light surfaces

Use `font-display` class for headings (Cinzel serif) and `font-body` for long text (Crimson Text).

- [ ] Click slot → kingdom detail (owner, points)

### Phase 8 — Army Missions
- [ ] `api/lib/speed.ts` — travel time formula (distance × base speed / unit speed)
- [ ] `POST /api/armies/send` — validate army, deduct units from kingdom, create army_mission row
- [ ] Mission types: attack, transport, spy, colonize, pillage, return
- [ ] Mission processing: background arrival check on each request (lazy)
- [ ] `GET /api/armies` — active missions with countdown
- [ ] Fleet page UI: send form + active missions list
